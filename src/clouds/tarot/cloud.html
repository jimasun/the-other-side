            <h3 class="title">TAROT</h3>
            <p>Tarot is a highly decorated and symbol-filled deck of cards, that can be used for playing but also for fortune telling by asking the cards a general or concrete question. The entire deck consists of 78 cards, which, when used in occult applications, are divided in two; Major Arcana - Greater Secrets - and Minor Arcana - Lesser Secrets. Major Arcana consists of 22 trump cards with no suits and Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards divided into four suits - swords, wands, coins and cups - of 14 cards each. In fortune telling Major Arcana represents forces that we cannot control, while Minor Arcana represents that which we have the power to change. The Major Arcana cards represent a path to spiritual self-awareness and the different stages one has to encounter in the search for greater meaning and understanding.</p>

            <p>Tarot cards comes with many different designs, one of the most popular decks were published in 1910 and drawn by the illustrator Pamela Colman Smith with instructions of academic and mystic A. E. Waite. The Other Site special edition of the Rider-Waite Major Arcana tarot cards can be found by clicking the little card animation.</p>

            <h3>HISTORY</h3>

            <p>The actual tarot cards originated in Italy in the 14th century. The decks were handmade, super expensive and actually only used as playing cards. The cards became less exclusive with the invention of the press and by the 15th century, the tarot cards were spread though Europe by Romas, who used them for fortune telling. But even then, the cards were not recognised as mystical until the late 18th century, when the Occult emerged. The cards’ origin were investigated and the people of the Occult made connections to Egyptian mythology, ancient Indian games, Gnosticism, The Kabbalah, astrology, alchemy and many other esoteric practices. It was though these studies the cards, which were previously viewed as sketchy entertainment, gained recognition for containing deep knowledge of real religion, philosophy and universal principles.</p></div></div>
