            <h3 class="title">PALM READING</h3>
            <p>Palm reading, or palmistry, is in a sense detective work. By slowly collecting information and make connections between all the information you can figure out a lot about a person. A good palm reading can reveal a lot about a persons character, opinions, motivation, behaviour and thought process.  And it can show how the person is acting in social situations and what expectations the person have in relation to other people. The reading can also explain the potential of the owner, innate abilities and talents. The information obtained through palm reading can also be used in psychological and medical respects.

            <p>Palmistry is practiced all over the world and has numerous cultural variations. There are many different schools of palmistry, which can lead to conflicting interpretations of various lines.</p>

            <p>Everything in your palm has a meaning, and once you start investigating your palm properly it can be a very long process. The Other Sites palm reading guide gives you a tool to draw in the greater lines of your palms and read about what those mean. However, these lines are only the tip of the iceberg and if you are more interested in palm reading you should study proper literature about the subject.</p>

            <h3>HISTORY</h3>

            <p>Because palmistry is commonly practiced in many countries and cultures, the history of its origin is – like many other esoteric practices – hard to be super specific about. However, several thousand years ago palmistry was widespread in Eastern countries like India, Nepal, Tibet, China, Persia, Sumeria, historic Palestine and Babylonia. The practise progressed to Greece where a Pre-Socratic philosopher dude named Anaxagoras took up the practise. Around 350-320 BCE Aristotle discovered a treatise on the subject of palmistry on an altar of Hermes and he presented it to Alexander the Great, who found it very interesting and started examining the characters of his officers by palm reading.</p>

            <p>In the middle ages palmistry was – again like many other esoteric practices ¬– suppressed by the church, and in the Renaissance the practice was classified as one of seven forbidden arts. Something shifted and in the 17th century many German universities had palmistry (chiromancy) in the curriculum. The Victorian interest made the practise blow up and many books written about palmistry is from this era.</p>

            <p>In newer times, the usage of fingerprints for identifying people is said to be a result of the many years and knowledge about the anatomy of the palm.</p>
