            <h3>ASTROLOGY</h3>

            <p>Astrology is a study of the correlation between the positions of the planets and events happening on earth.</p>

            <p>Astrology can be viewed as a way of painting a picture of the development the individual has reached in the current incarnation. When reincarnated, the self selects a life pattern according to growth and further evolvement. In the chain of reincarnations the self enters the astrological picture with more and more knowledge about the cosmic powers.</p>

            <p>You probably know about the little vague 2-sentences-per-sign-horoscopes from magazines. If you know these, then you most likely know your Sun-sign. But you have many more signs in your chart, since each planet in our solar system had it’s own position at the time you were born.  In astrology it is factual that each of the planetary positions has a direct influence on your character. If you know the date, time and place of your birth, you can calculate your natal chart online.</p>

            <p>Each sign has a ruling planet, which governs and imbues it with certain personality traits. They also have a quality; cardinal, fixed or mutable. Cardinal signs are the ones that start every season, they are seen as “the leaders” of the zodiac. Fixed signs are in the middle of the season, and are seen as “the stabilizers” of the zodiac. Mutable signs end every season and are seen as “the adapters” of the zodiac. Each zodiac also has one of four elements; fire, earth, air or water. Fire signs tend to be passionate, dynamic and temperamental. Air signs tend to be all about action, ideas and motion. Earth signs are the grounded, slow and steady zodiacs. And finally the water signs are the intuitive, emotional, sensitive and mysterious ones.</p>

            <h3>HISTORY</h3>

            <p>The earliest known signs of human curiosity for the night sky is dated all the way back to 25.000 – 10.000 BCE and shows different phases of the moon scratched into animal bones. The Sun, the stars and The Moon have always played a significant role to the human race; The Sun brought light and safety from the darkness of the night, where only stars and The Moon would provide light. In the darkness the stars started creating shapes like animals. Because the interest started so early -- before there was a written language -- it is hard to say how exactly astrology came about. However, the Western astrology that we know today, originated in the Mediterranean area about 600 BCE and was documented by Romans and Greeks. In 100 CE a Greek scientist guy called Ptolemæus wrote a book called Tetrabiblos. This book contained all his knowledge of natal astrology, which is the branch of astrology that focuses on birth horoscopes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, astrology seemed to go out of fashion. However, in the Middle Age about 1000 CE the interest was sparked again, even though the church had a love/hate relationship with astrologists, which led to either collaboration or persecution. Around 1500 CE during the Renaissance astrology had reached full potential. Business, wars, travels and marriages were planned with the celestial positions in mind; in this era the astrologists were viewed as scientists. Today astrology is still practiced and there are many different branches and schools, but the most popular form of astrology is the one based on Ptolemæus’ Tetrabiblos.</p></div></div>
